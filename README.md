# CrystalcraftPBR
This texture pack adds normal and specular maps to the textures of the Crystalcraft Unlimited mod. This means that the textures have depth, reflections and in some cases, like ores, they also glow.

**How to use:**
1. Download [the texture pack](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/crystalcraftpbr) and put it in the “resourcepacks” folder.
2. Download a shader, that suports PBR and put it in the “shaderpacks” folder.

The parts of the textures that are based on vanilla textures, such as the rock around ores, are based on the [SPBR resource pack](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/spbr).
